However, the execution of the primary agent failed (0 of 1 successful), indicating a potential configuration or connectivity issue that prevented the core analytical workflow from running. Overall system health is stable, but the analysis is incomplete due to the agent execution failure.\n\n## Technical Findings\n- **Agent Execution Failure**: 0 of 1 agents executed successfully, preventing the full analysis from running and yielding no actionable insights.\n- **No Data Issues Detected**: Zero issues were found across all fields, suggesting the underlying data structure is sound but not fully processed.\n- **No Alerts or Recommendations**: The absence of alerts or recommendations indicates the analysis did not reach a stage where insights could be generated.\n- **Fast Execution Time**: The analysis completed in 3.71 seconds, showing the system is responsive but the workflow is incomplete.\n\n## Recommended Actions\n- **Priority 1: Investigate Agent Configuration**: Review and validate the agent's setup, permissions, and connectivity to resolve the execution failure and enable full analysis.\n- **Priority 2: Verify Data Source Access**: Ensure the agent has proper access to required data sources to prevent silent failures during execution.\n- **Priority 3: Implement Agent Health Monitoring**: Set up real-time monitoring for agent status to detect and alert on execution failures promptly.\n- **Priority 4: Test with a Simplified Workflow**: Run a basic test case to isolate whether the issue is with the agent or the analysis logic.\n\n## Next Steps\nRe-run the analysis after addressing the agent execution failure to generate complete insights and recommendations. Monitor agent performance and data pipeline health continuously to ensure reliable future executions.",
