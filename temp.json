While the execution of all agents was successful, the cleanse preview score of 70.0/100 suggests room for improvement in data completeness and handling of null values.\n\n## Technical Findings\n- **Cleanse Preview Score**: At 70.0/100, the dataset shows good accuracy and safety but lacks completeness, indicating potential gaps in data quality.\n- **Null Handling**: A significant number of 5,915 nulls were handled, yet no reduction was achieved, highlighting a need for a more effective null handling strategy.\n- **Field Standardization**: While 8 columns were standardized with a 100% improvement rate, no variations were reduced, suggesting a lack of comprehensive synonym mapping.\n- **Outlier Removal**: Successfully handled 2,841 outliers with a 100% reduction, demonstrating effective outlier management.\n\n## Recommended Actions\n- **Priority 1**: Implement a synonym mapping strategy to enhance field standardization and improve the completeness score.\n- **Priority 2**: Review and enhance the null handling strategy to achieve a reduction in null values and improve data quality.\n- **Priority 3**: Conduct a comprehensive review of the standardization process to ensure all variations are adequately addressed.\n- **Priority 4**: Monitor the cleanse writeback process to ensure all transformations are logged and maintain data integrity.\n\n## Next Steps\nProceed with the implementation of the recommended actions while continuously monitoring the dataset for improvements in quality metrics. Regular reviews should be scheduled to assess the effectiveness of the changes made.",
